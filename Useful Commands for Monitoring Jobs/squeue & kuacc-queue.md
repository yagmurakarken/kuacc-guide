# squeue & kuacc-queue

After submitting jobs, user needs to monitor jobs to check resource usage.
**squeue:** views information about jobs located in the Slurm scheduling queue.<br>
`squeue –u username`<br>

**kuacc-queue:** Shows Jobs details on queue. It ıs detailed version of squeue command.<br>
`kuacc-queue|grep username`<br>
or<br>
`kuacc-queue|more`<br>

Command output lists information about jobs.

## JOBID, PARTITION, NAME, USER, TIME_LEFT, TIME_LIMIT, START_TIME, ST, NODES, CPUS, NODELIST(REASON)
### ST:STATE

|State|	Code|	Meaning|
| ------| ------------ | ----- |
|PENDING|	PD|	Job is awaiting resource allocation.|
|RUNNING|	R|	Job currently has an allocation.|
|SUSPENDED|	S|	Job has an allocation, but execution has been suspended.|
|COMPLETING|	CG|	Job is in the process of completing. Some processes on some nodes may still be active.|
|COMPLETED|	CD|	Job has terminated all processes on all nodes.|
|CONFIGURING|	CF|	 Job has been allocated resources, but are waiting for them to become ready for use|
|CANCELED|	CA|	Job was explicitly cancelled by the user or system administrator.
The job may or may not have been initiated.|
|FAILED|	F|	Job terminated with non-zero exit code or other failure condition.|
|TIMEOUT|	TO|	Job terminated upon reaching its time limit.|
|PREEMPTED|	PR|	Job has been suspended by an higher priority job on the same ressource.|
|NODE_FAIL|	NF|	Job terminated due to failure of one or more allocated nodes.|

Note: Preempted state means that your job is killed and re-queued because of priority. Research groups donate compute nodes and they have priority on the nodes. If they submit a job and there is no resource on the node, jobs belonging to general user are killed and requeued. To avoid this, you may use IT nodes. IT (it01-it04) doesn’t have priority. Also, you can exclude nodes by exclude parameter in slurm.


###  NODELIST(REASON) 
This column lists nodes running jobs. Also, it gives the reason for Jobs state.

|Reason|	Meaning|
| ------| ------------ |
|InvalidQOS|	The job’s QOS is invalid.|
|Priority|	One or more higher priority jobs is in queue for running. Your job will eventually run.|
|Resources|	The job is waiting for resources to become available and will eventually run.|
|PartitionNodeLimit|	The number of nodes required by this job is outside of it’s partitions current limits. Can also indicate that required nodes are DOWN or DRAINED.|
|PartitionTimeLimit|	The job’s time limit exceeds it’s partition’s current time limit.|
|QOSJobLimit|	The job’s QOS has reached its maximum job count.|
|QOSResourceLimit|	The job’s QOS has reached some resource limit.|
|QOSTimeLimit|	The job’s QOS has reached its time limit.|
|QOSMaxCpuPerUserLimit|	Maximum number of cpus per user for your job’s QoS have been met; job will run eventually.|
|QOSGrpMaxJobsLimit|	Maximum number of jobs for your job’s QoS have been met; job will run eventually.|
|QOSGrpCpuLimit|	All CPUs assigned to your job’s specified QoS are in use; job will run eventually.|
|QOSGrpNodeLimit|	All nodes assigned to your job’s specified QoS are in use; job will run eventually.|

Note: Most often you encounter with **Priority**, **Resources** and **QOSMaxCpuPerUserLimit**.
